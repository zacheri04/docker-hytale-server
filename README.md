## Quick Start Guide

### Quick Start with Docker Compose

This example `docker-compose.yml` will create a server on the default port 5520 with 8GB of RAM.

1. Create a new folder and open it
2. Paste the following into new file named `docker-compose.yml`:

```yml:docker-compose.yml
services:
  hytale:
    network_mode: "host"
    image: zacheri/hytale-server
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    ports:
      - "5520:5520"
    environment:
      - MEMORY=8G
      - PORT=5520
    volumes:
      - ./:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

3. First time setup requires some configuration. Run with `docker compose up`
4. Click the link in the terminal to authenticate via the Hytale website to complete the server file download
5. When the server is started as shown below, press `Ctrl + C` to stop it
6. Run `docker compose up -d`
7. Run `docker ps` and find the container ID
8. Run `docker attach [container-id]` as shown below
9. You're now in the server console. Run `/auth login device` and follow the authentication prompt similar to step 4.
10. OPTIONAL (but recommended): Run `/auth persistence Encrypted`. This will save your authentication so you don't have to run it every time the server starts.
11. You can now run `Ctrl P, Q` to detach from the Docker container.
12. You're done. Connect with your server's IP address on port 5520. You can stop the server with `docker stop [container-id]` and start it with `docker compose up -d`.
